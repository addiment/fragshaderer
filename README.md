WebGL fragment shader "playground"

## Why?

Because shaders are cool! I love graphics programming, but writing WebGL/OpenGL boilerplate gives me a headache.
My solution was to make a super-basic click-to-compile fragment shader sandbox. It's just a &lt;textarea&gt;, so it's pretty clunky, but it gets the job done. Maybe in the future I'll set it up with Monaco, but don't expect anything for now.
